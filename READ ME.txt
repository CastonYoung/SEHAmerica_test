Hi my name is Caston Young, and I know I am a bit late in delivering this, but I had a ton
of set backs, like even more than the usual ton of set backs in programing.
(I spent the first 3 days just trying to get Visual Studio to work and packages to install.)
Anyways, although I haven't actually used WinForms in a long time, I thought it would be
easier to setup than a WPF app, and while that may have been the case at first, I didn't
realize that RichTextBox didn't come with a default UI, and umm you may have to format the
text inside the powerpoint itself.  You can copy and paste the text into the RichTextBox,
or hit the Read button to bring it over; however, the only text that matters is in the 
title field and the powerpoint itself.  There is one more big caveat though, and that's
that the list of images can only show small icons for seemingly no reason.
